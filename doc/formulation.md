## 1 Data

### 1.1 Sets

* Let $\mathcal T$ be the set of tasks that need to be completed.
* Let $\mathcal R$ be the set of resources that can complete the tasks.
* Let $\mathcal Q_r$ be the set of tasks that resource $r\in\mathcal R$ can perform.

### 1.2 Data Inputs

* Let $\eta_t$ be the number of hours for a task $t\in\mathcal T$.
* Let $\lambda_r$ be the cost per hour for a resource $r\in\mathcal R$.
* Let $\gamma_r$ be the number of hours that a resource $r\in\mathcal R$ can work in one day.

### 1.3 Data Transformations

* Let $\theta_{rt}$ be the cost for a resource $r\in\mathcal R$ performing a task $t\in\mathcal T$.

$$ \theta_{rt} = \eta_t \cdot \lambda_r \qquad\forall r\in\mathcal R,\,t\in\mathcal T$$

## 2 Decision Variables

* Let $x_{rt}\in{0, 1}$ be one if the resource $r\in\mathcal R$ is assigned to perform task $t\in\mathcal T$, 0 otherwise.

## 3 Objective

The objective function for the model is to minimize the cost of assigning the resources to tasks.

$$\text{Minimize}\,\sum_{r\in\mathcal R}\sum_{t\in\mathcal T} \theta_{rt}\cdot x_{rt}$$

## 4 Constraints

### 4.1 Ensure Each Resource Stays within their Allowed Hours

Each resource can only be assigned tasks whose total time must be no more than their maximum hours for a day.

$$\sum_{t\in\mathcal T} \gamma_t \cdot x_{rt} \le \gamma_r \qquad\forall r\in\mathcal R$$

### 4.2 Assign Each Task to only One Resource

Each task can only be assigned to be performed one task in the model.

$$\sum_{t\in\mathcal T} x_{rt} = 1 \qquad\forall r\in\mathcal R$$
